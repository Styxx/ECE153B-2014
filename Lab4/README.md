<h1>Lab 4 - DC Motor Control</h1>

<h5>Objective:</h5>
* Interact with the motor's ChA and ChB to view motor's position and direction
* Modulate the motor's speed (with a PWM) and direction by driving it with an H-Bridge
* Create a C-interface and a PID controller to have the motor work in a windshield wiper fashion.


<h5>Files:</h5>
* __fsm.v__ - Finite state machine that completes objectives 1 and 2 without the PWM
